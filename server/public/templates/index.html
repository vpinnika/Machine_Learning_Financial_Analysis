            This project is makes use of machine learning algorithms and technical indicators to perform financial analysis on the stock market. Nothing can predict the stock market to a tee, especially given the volatile market conditions. However, we can use tools to attempt to forecast directional movements in the market. This app is built on several technologies including:
            <ul>
                <li>Pandas / DataReader</li>
                <li>Numpy</li>
                <li>Yahoo Finance API</li>
                <li>Matplotlib</li>
                <li>Sci-Kit Learn</li>
            </ul>
            So the question remains, how will we make our stock picks? What are the potential risks and rewards for a stock compared to its competitors?
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Analyzing:</strong>
            <br>
            We start off by analyzing historical price data. We do this by extracting the data via Yahoo Finance API and Pandas Data-Reader. We then perform exploratory analysis using a correlation heatmap, moving averages along with other Matplotlib visualizations and features. We also perform a predictive analysis using K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and quadratic discriminant analysis. 

            Using these features, we can attempt to guide our decision making process when making a trade.
